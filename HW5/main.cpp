\mainpage Shader Excercises

\tableofcontents

\section intro Introduction

This program displays all of the 9 shader excercises from the homework. Some are using boxes, some are using circles, some
are fractals.

\subsection options User Options

- Escape:  Ends the program.
- M: Toggles between fill mode and line mode to draw the triangles.
- R: Resets the window size to 700 X 500.
- A: Resets the window size to 600 X 600.
- F10: Saves a screen shot of the graphics window to a png file.
- 1: Excercise 1 (Red circles)
- 2: Excercise 2 (Red/green circles)
- 3: An image that has many small boxes similar to graph paper, red and purple lines in x and y directions.
- 4: A black and red checkerboard.
- 5: Blue circles moving from the inside out.
- 6: A checkerboard that alternates between black and red to green and black, with blue circles moving in to out.
- 7: Fractal with q^2
- 8: Fractal with q^3
- 9: Fractal with q^4


\note Note that the shader programs "AspectRatioVert.glsl" and "StrangeFrag.glsl" are expected
to be in the same folder as the executable.  Your graphics card must also be able to support
OpenGL version 3.3 to run this program.
