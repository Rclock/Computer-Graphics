This program displays all of the 9 shader excercises from the homework. Some are using boxes, some are using circles, some are fractals.\hypertarget{index_options}{}\subsection{User Options}\label{index_options}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Escape\+: Ends the program.
\item M\+: Toggles between fill mode and line mode to draw the triangles.
\item R\+: Resets the window size to 700 X 500.
\item A\+: Resets the window size to 600 X 600.
\item F10\+: Saves a screen shot of the graphics window to a png file.
\item 1\+: Excercise 1 (Red circles)
\item 2\+: Excercise 2 (Red/green circles)
\item 3\+: An image that has many small boxes similar to graph paper, red and purple lines in x and y directions.
\item 4\+: A black and red checkerboard.
\item 5\+: Blue circles moving from the inside out.
\item 6\+: A checkerboard that alternates between black and red to green and black, with blue circles moving in to out.
\item 7\+: Fractal with q$^\wedge$2
\item 8\+: Fractal with q$^\wedge$3
\item 9\+: Fractal with q$^\wedge$4

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Note that the shader programs \char`\"{}\+Aspect\+Ratio\+Vert.\+glsl\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}\+Strange\+Frag.\+glsl\char`\"{} are expected to be in the same folder as the executable. Your graphics card must also be able to support Open\+GL version 3.\+3 to run this program.
