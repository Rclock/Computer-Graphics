\section{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_box}{Box} \\*Holds position and color data for a multicolored rectangle. It also has facilities for loading the data to the graphics card and invoking draw commands on the data }{\pageref{class_box}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_graphics_engine}{Graphics\+Engine} \\*Extension of sf\+::\+Render\+Window which handles all of the graphics rendering in the program }{\pageref{class_graphics_engine}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{struct_shader_info}{Shader\+Info} \\*Structure that holds shader information }{\pageref{struct_shader_info}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_shape}{Shape} \\*Base class for the shapes we will be using in the scene. Shapes that will be used will be derived from this class, making graphing code a little cleaner }{\pageref{class_shape}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{class_u_i}{UI} \\*Handles the user interface event processing for the program. It contains a pointer to the graphics engine as the communication link to the graphics and scene objects }{\pageref{class_u_i}}{}
