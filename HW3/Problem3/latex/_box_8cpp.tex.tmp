\subsection{Detailed Description}
Rectangle object with yellow outlining, selecting, deselecting, and dragging capabilities. 

This rectangle object has capabilities for a yellow outline to be drawn with it\textquotesingle{}s own arrays and coordinates, has functionality to \char`\"{}select\char`\"{} itself (yellow outline), functionality to compare mouse coordinates to all of the boxes, deselect itself, and modify center coordinates of yellow outline and box itself in order to \char`\"{}drag\char`\"{} the box and outline. Two index arrays, one for the box and one for the outline. One of size 6 and one of size 4. One draws 2 triangles, one draws a line loop across 4 vertices to make a box outline. The load functions Load data to the graphics card in a similar fashion to how we have done it in the past.
