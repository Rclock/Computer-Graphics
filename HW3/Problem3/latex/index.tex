This project attempts to do many different things to small boxes. You can drag, create, delete, move, scale, outline, recolor, and more.\hypertarget{index_options}{}\subsection{User Options}\label{index_options}
If no modifier keys are pressed\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Escape\+: Ends the program.
\item M\+: Toggles between fill mode and line mode to draw the triangles.
\item R\+: Resets the window size to 700 X 500.
\item A\+: Resets the window size to 600 X 600.
\item F10\+: Saves a screen shot of the graphics window to a png file.
\item Left\+: Moves all selected boxes and their outlines to the left with state processing.
\item Right\+: Moves all selected boxes and their outlines to the left with state processing.
\item Up\+: Moves all selected boxes and outlines upward with state processing.
\item Down\+: Moves all selected boxes and outlines downward with state processing.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If you mouse hover over a box\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item That box turns red.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If the control key is down\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Left\+: Decreases the width of all selected boxes with their outlines.
\item Right\+: Increases the width of all selected boxes with their outlines.
\item Up\+: Decreases the height of all selected boxes with their outlines.
\item Down\+: Increases the height of all selected boxes with their outlines.
\item Left Click Inside of a box\+: Selects the box
\item Left C\+Lick outside of a box\+: Deselects all boxes
\item C\+T\+RL + A \+: Selects all boxes.
\item C\+T\+RL + Q \+: Deselects all boxes.
\item Left Click and drag\+: Drags the clicked-\/on box in the direction of the mouse smoothly with no snapping.
\item Right C\+Lick\+: Creates a box with it\textquotesingle{}s center at the origin of the mouse click. Randomly sized between .1-\/.\+3 widths and heights. \hyperlink{class_box}{Box} is a random color too.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If the alt key is down\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Left\+: Decreases the width and height of all of the selected boxes and their outlines.
\item Right\+: Increases the width and height of all of the selected boxes and their outlines.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If the shift key is down\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Left Click and Drag on a selected box\+: Drags all selected boxes on the screen identically.
\end{DoxyItemize}

N\+O\+TE\+: The Blue, green, and white functionality by pressing alt+B, G, etc has not been called from the \hyperlink{class_u_i}{UI} in this project. You would have to specify which box, it would not work just bringing it in from the previous excercise as we are to re-\/use our code from program 2. This was not discussed in the description of excercise 3 so it has not been called from the \hyperlink{class_u_i}{UI} and is not functional here.

I think that is all of the functionalities. If I havent listed them here, but they were in the requirements, they are in the program. It does everything from number 3.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Note that the shader programs \char`\"{}\+Pass\+Through\+Vert.\+glsl\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}\+Pass\+Through\+Frag.\+glsl\char`\"{} are expected to be in the same folder as the executable. Your graphics card must also be able to support Open\+GL version 3.\+3 to run this program.
