\mainpage Boxes Part 2

\tableofcontents

\section intro Introduction

An updated version of the first program, added in mouse hovering functions to turn the box red if the mouse is over it, and
click and drag functions for the entire box itself.

The console window will display your graphics card OpenGL version support and the
graphics window will display a multicolored box.  The title bar of the window will also
display the number of frames per second for the last second.

\subsection options User Options

If no modifier keys are pressed:

- Escape:  Ends the program.
- M: Toggles between fill mode and line mode to draw the triangles.
- R: Resets the window size to 700 X 500.
- A: Resets the window size to 600 X 600.
- F10: Saves a screen shot of the graphics window to a png file.
- Left: Moves the box to the left.
- Right: Moves the box to the right.
- Up: Moves the box up.
- Down: Moves the box down.

If the control key is down:

- Left: Decreases the width of the box.
- Right: Increases the width of the box.
- Up: Decreases the height of the box.
- Down: Increases the height of the box.
- R: Resets the box size.

If the alt is down:
- B: Box turns blue
- W: Box turns white
- G: Box turns green
- M: Box reverts to original 4 color mix

If the mouse hovers over the box:
- Turns the box red.

If the box is left clicked and dragged:
- The box gets dragged with the mouse with no snapping to the center of the box.


\note Note that the shader programs "PassThroughVert.glsl" and "PassThroughFrag.glsl" are expected
to be in the same folder as the executable.  Your graphics card must also be able to support
OpenGL version 3.3 to run this program.
