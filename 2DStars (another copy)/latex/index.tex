This program has three planets and a sun, along with random shooting stars. The planets can take on many different forms, so be sure to press the T key as is displayed on the screen to see all of the different planets available. Make sure to also listen for the sound and look for the text that shows up when a shooting star appears.

The console window will display your graphics card Open\+GL version support and the graphics window will display a cool star animation. The title bar of the window will also display the number of frames per second for the last second.\hypertarget{index_options}{}\subsection{User Options}\label{index_options}
