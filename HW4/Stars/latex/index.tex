This program generates many stars on the screen with random rotational velocity, translational velocity, scale factor, number of points, color, etc.

They will animate across the screen until they are completely off the screen, at which point the memory allocated for that star is deleted and the vector holding the stars and data for them is shrunk. So, you could let this run for a while and be fine.

The console window will display your graphics card Open\+GL version support and the graphics window will display a multicolored box. The title bar of the window will also display the number of frames per second for the last second.\hypertarget{index_options}{}\subsection{User Options}\label{index_options}
