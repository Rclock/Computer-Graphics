/**
\mainpage Bubbles Screensaver

\tableofcontents

\section intro Introduction

This is a bubble screensaver program. Random number of bubbles from 10-60 will be generated and bounce around the screen .
Aspect ratio is included. Bubbles will change color each bounce, using the fragment shader and a uniform vec4 sent in from the
graphics engine depending on the bubble. Bubbles bounce in a natural manner.

The console window will display your graphics card OpenGL version support and the
graphics window will display a bubbles screensaver.  The title bar of the window will also
display the number of frames per second for the last second.

\subsection options User Options

If no modifier keys are pressed:

- Escape:  Ends the program.
- M: Toggles between fill mode and line mode to draw the triangles.

- F10: Saves a screen shot of the graphics window to a png file.
- S: Vertical sync on or off.





\note Note that the shader programs "PassThroughVert.glsl" and "PassThroughFrag.glsl" are expected
to be in the same folder as the executable.  Your graphics card must also be able to support
OpenGL version 3.3 to run this program.
