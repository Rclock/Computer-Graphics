This is a bubble screensaver program. Random number of bubbles from 10-\/60 will be generated and bounce around the screen . Aspect ratio is included. Bubbles will change color each bounce, using the fragment shader and a uniform vec4 sent in from the graphics engine depending on the bubble. Bubbles bounce in a natural manner.

The console window will display your graphics card Open\+GL version support and the graphics window will display a bubbles screensaver. The title bar of the window will also display the number of frames per second for the last second.\hypertarget{index_options}{}\subsection{User Options}\label{index_options}
