\subsection{Detailed Description}
\hyperlink{class_circle}{Circle} object with color, scale factor, random speed. 

Each circle is set up with a random scale factor to be used with a scaling matrix. Each circle has a randomly generated speed associated with it, which updates it\textquotesingle{}s position. Each circle is intialized with a random vec4 to send to the fragment shader also, which is changed if it bounces. Every circle starts at the center.
