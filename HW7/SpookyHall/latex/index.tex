This program puts you in a spooky hallway and you are able to move forward and backward with your candle light that lights the hall infront of you.\hypertarget{index_options}{}\subsection{User Options}\label{index_options}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Escape\+: Ends the program.
\item M\+: Toggles between fill mode and line mode to draw the triangles.
\item F10\+: Saves a screen shot of the graphics window to a png file.
\item F11 or O\+: Turns on the spherical camera.
\item F12 or P\+: Turns on the yaw-\/pitch-\/roll camera.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If the spherical camera is on\+:

If no modifier keys are pressed\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Left\+: Increases the camera\textquotesingle{}s theta value.
\item Right\+: Decreases the camera\textquotesingle{}s theta value.
\item Up\+: Increases the camera\textquotesingle{}s psi value.
\item Down\+: Decreases the camera\textquotesingle{}s psi value.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If the control or Z key is down\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Up\+: Decreases the camera\textquotesingle{}s radius.
\item Down\+: Increases the camera\textquotesingle{}s radius.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If the yaw-\/pitch-\/roll camera is on\+:

If the control key is down\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Up\+: Moves the camera forward.
\item Down\+: Moves the camera backward.
\end{DoxyItemize}

For the light\+:

If the control key is down\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Up\+: Moves light forward.
\item Down\+: Moves light backward.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If the spherical camera is currently selected, a click and drag with the left mouse button will alter the theta and psi angles of the spherical camera to give the impression of the mouse grabbing and moving the coordinate system.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Note that the shader programs \char`\"{}\+Vertex\+Shader\+Lighting\+Texture.\+glsl\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}\+Phong\+Multiple\+Lights\+And\+Texture.\+glsl\char`\"{} are expected to be in the same folder as the executable. Your graphics card must also be able to support Open\+GL version 3.\+3 to run this program.
