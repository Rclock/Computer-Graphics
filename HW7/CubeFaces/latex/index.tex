\hypertarget{index_intro}{}\section{Introduction}\label{index_intro}
This program has a cube with multiple textures of famous math/\+CS people\textquotesingle{}s faces on it. You can turn the lighting on/off and the textures on/off. This program uses 6 different V\+BO\textquotesingle{}s to draw the 6 faces seperately.\hypertarget{index_options}{}\subsection{User Options}\label{index_options}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Escape\+: Ends the program.
\item M\+: Toggles between fill mode and line mode to draw the triangles.
\item F6\+: Turns lighting off if it is on, turns the lighting on if it is off.
\item F7\+: Turns the textures off if they are on, turns them on if they are off.
\item F10\+: Saves a screen shot of the graphics window to a png file.
\item F11 or O\+: Turns on the spherical camera.
\item F12 or P\+: Turns on the yaw-\/pitch-\/roll camera.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If the spherical camera is on\+:

If no modifier keys are pressed\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Left\+: Increases the camera\textquotesingle{}s theta value.
\item Right\+: Decreases the camera\textquotesingle{}s theta value.
\item Up\+: Increases the camera\textquotesingle{}s psi value.
\item Down\+: Decreases the camera\textquotesingle{}s psi value.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If the control or Z key is down\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Up\+: Decreases the camera\textquotesingle{}s radius.
\item Down\+: Increases the camera\textquotesingle{}s radius.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If the yaw-\/pitch-\/roll camera is on\+:

If no modifier keys are pressed\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Left\+: Increases the yaw.
\item Right\+: Decreases the yaw.
\item Up\+: Increases the pitch.
\item Down\+: Decreases the pitch.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If the control or Z key is down\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Left\+: Increases the roll.
\item Right\+: Decreases the roll.
\item Up\+: Moves the camera forward.
\item Down\+: Moves the camera backward.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If the shift or S key is down\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Left\+: Moves the camera left.
\item Right\+: Moves the camera right.
\item Up\+: Moves the camera up.
\item Down\+: Moves the camera down.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If the Alt or the X key is down then the movement is on one of the lights\+:

If no modifier keys are pressed\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Left\+: Increases the light\textquotesingle{}s theta value.
\item Right\+: Decreases the light\textquotesingle{}s theta value.
\item Up\+: Increases the light\textquotesingle{}s psi value.
\item Down\+: Decreases the light\textquotesingle{}s psi value.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If the control or Z key is down\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Up\+: Decreases the light\textquotesingle{}s radius.
\item Down\+: Increases the light\textquotesingle{}s radius.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If the spherical camera is currently selected, a click and drag with the left mouse button will alter the theta and psi angles of the spherical camera to give the impression of the mouse grabbing and moving the coordinate system.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Note that the shader programs \char`\"{}\+Vertex\+Shader\+Lighting\+Texture.\+glsl\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}\+Phong\+Multiple\+Lights\+And\+Texture.\+glsl\char`\"{} are expected to be in the same folder as the executable. Your graphics card must also be able to support Open\+GL version 3.\+3 to run this program.
