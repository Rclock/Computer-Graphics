\section intro Introduction

This program has three planets and a sun, along with random shooting stars. The planets can take on many different forms, so
be sure to press the T key as is displayed on the screen to see all of the different planets available. Make sure to also
listen for the sound and look for the text that shows up when a shooting star appears.


The console window will display your graphics card OpenGL version support and the
graphics window will display a cool star animation.  The title bar of the window will also
display the number of frames per second for the last second.

 \subsection options User Options

- Escape:  Ends the program.
- M: Toggles between fill mode and line mode to draw the triangles
- F: Freezes the planets where they are. You can still cycle the textures.
- F10: Saves a screen shot of the graphics window to a png file.
- S: Vertical sync on or off
- T: Cycles the textures that are on the planets.
