\hyperlink{class_ties}{Ties} class implementation. Makes 500 ties between 500 points on the two tracks. Uses two points for each tie. Picks a point from one track and corresponding point from the other track, draws a tie between them using G\+L\+\_\+\+L\+I\+N\+ES drawing mode. Loads data to graphics card using a simple V\+AO and buffer for storage.
