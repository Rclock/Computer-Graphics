\hypertarget{index_intro}{}\section{Introduction}\label{index_intro}
This program creates a railroad track in 3 Dimensions inspired by the Polar Express movie. You may observe the tracks using the default spherical camera, or press F12 to engage the \char`\"{}\+Railroad\char`\"{} camera to ride down the tracks.

\hyperlink{class_axes}{Axes} are included and can be turned off with the user interface below.\hypertarget{index_options}{}\subsection{User Options}\label{index_options}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item M\+: Toggles between fill mode and line mode to draw the triangles.
\item F1\+: Sets the flag to draw a single box.
\item F2\+: Sets the flag to draw a grid of boxes.
\item F3\+: Sets the flag to draw boxes.
\item F4\+: Sets the flag to hide boxes.
\item F5\+: Draws the axes.
\item F6\+: Turns off the axes.
\item F10\+: Saves a screen shot of the graphics window to a png file.
\item F11\+: Turns on the spherical camera.
\item F12\+: Turns on the railroad camera.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If the spherical camera is currently selected,

If no modifier keys are pressed\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Left\+: Increases the camera\textquotesingle{}s theta value.
\item Right\+: Decreases the camera\textquotesingle{}s theta value.
\item Up\+: Increases the camera\textquotesingle{}s psi value.
\item Down\+: Decreases the camera\textquotesingle{}s psi value.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If the control or Z key is down\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Up\+: Decreases the camera\textquotesingle{}s radius.
\item Down\+: Increases the camera\textquotesingle{}s radius.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If the yaw-\/pitch-\/roll camera is currently selected,

If no modifier keys are pressed\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Left\+: Increases the yaw.
\item Right\+: Decreases the yaw.
\item Up\+: Increases the pitch.
\item Down\+: Decreases the pitch.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If the control or Z key is down\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Left\+: Increases the roll.
\item Right\+: Decreases the roll.
\item Up\+: Moves the camera forward.
\item Down\+: Moves the camera backward.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If the shift or S key is down\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Left\+: Moves the camera left.
\item Right\+: Moves the camera right.
\item Up\+: Moves the camera up.
\item Down\+: Moves the camera down.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If the spherical camera is currently selected, a click and drag with the left mouse button will alter the theta and psi angles of the spherical camera to give the impression of the mouse grabbing and moving the coordinate system.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Note that the shader programs \char`\"{}\+Vertex\+Shader\+Basic3\+D.\+glsl\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}\+Pass\+Through\+Frag.\+glsl\char`\"{} are expected to be in the same folder as the executable. Your graphics card must also be able to support Open\+GL version 3.\+3 to run this program.
