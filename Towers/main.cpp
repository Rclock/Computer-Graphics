\section intro Introduction

Towers program using 3 light sources at the specified locations, the light object functionality has been commented out so they are
stationary lights. 4 Towers made of five blue plastic tauri and a silver sphere. Their emission (r)gb value is increased over
a sin function of time along with factors for animation speeding up and slowing down. Plane is emerald.


\subsection options User Options

- Escape:  Ends the program.
- M: Toggles between fill mode and line mode to draw the triangles.
- F10: Saves a screen shot of the graphics window to a png file.
- F11 or O: Turns on the spherical camera.
- F12 or P: Turns on the yaw-pitch-roll camera.
- S: Speeds up the animation (can press and hold too)
- A: Slows down the animation. (Messes up when it gets really slow currently)

Mouse wheel Functionality:
- Forwards: Decrease Spherical camera's R value (move closer to scene)
- Backwards: Increase Spherical camera R value (further from camera)

If the spherical camera is currently selected,

If no modifier keys are pressed:

- Left: Increases the camera's theta value.
- Right: Decreases the camera's theta value.
- Up: Increases the camera's psi value.
- Down: Decreases the camera's psi value.

If the control or Z key is down:

- Up: Decreases the camera's radius.
- Down: Increases the camera's radius.

If the yaw-pitch-roll camera is currently selected,

If no modifier keys are pressed:

- Left: Increases the yaw.
- Right: Decreases the yaw.
- Up: Increases the pitch.
- Down: Decreases the pitch.

If the control or Z key is down:

- Left: Increases the roll.
- Right: Decreases the roll.
- Up: Moves the camera forward.
- Down: Moves the camera backward.

If the shift or S key is down:

- Left: Moves the camera left.
- Right: Moves the camera right.
- Up: Moves the camera up.
- Down: Moves the camera down.




If the spherical camera is currently selected, a click and drag with the left mouse
button will alter the theta and psi angles of the spherical camera to give the impression
of the mouse grabbing and moving the coordinate system.

\note Note that the shader programs "VertexShaderLighting.glsl" and "PhongOneLight.glsl"
are expected to be in the same folder as the executable.  Your graphics card must also be
able to support OpenGL version 3.3 to run this program.
